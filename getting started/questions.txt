1- Can we link assets like fontawesome, jquery, bootstrap etc in app/index.html ???
If we do this that will not be minified i guess ???

2- What should be the location for assets (images, bootstrap, fontawesome, images) ???
vendor? dist?
ember-cli-build.js > should we app.import('....css'); and app.import('....js'); files there and those will be used by system ???
will ember include css and head and js files in footer automatically ??? 
How can I order js and css files ??? same order as in ember-cli-build.js ???
Can I use public directory to store images ??? 
public/images/
public/fonts/

3- dist folder changes and files get replaced when we give command ember > build ???
whats the point of dist when there is only a blank index page ???

4- app.css is blank .... should we use it? Can I put my styles in it ???

5- how to clean tmp folder ??? can i just delete contents from it?

6- how page title will be changed for each page? index.html is not a hbs template to use {{}} in it ???

7- for apps developed in ember, reactjs /// we need vps or ps to deploy at... regular hosting like cpanel won't work, coz cpanel does not provide root access ... ??? but angular apps can be deployed at cpanel hosting coz they dont have environment restriction ... 

8- what is ember data ???
